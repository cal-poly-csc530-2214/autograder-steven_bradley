### Goals
* Get Sketch compiling on my computer
* Run examples from Sketch manual to better understand it


### Description
For this assignment, I spent the bulk of the time figuring out how to get Sketch to compile on my computer. Many of the issues were the result of a bad version of Sketch (1.7.5). This issue was resolved by upgrading to 1.7.6. In addition to this, I needed to install an older version of JRE to allow Sketch to run properly. This proved to be a bit more challenging because JRE 1.6 is not as readily available as it used to be.

Once I got Sketch running properly on my computer, I took a look at the Sketch manual and implemented a few of the examples presented there. The purpose of this was to get a better idea of how Sketch worked and what it is capable of. While there is still some confusion in general, I think I understand the basics of Sketch now.
